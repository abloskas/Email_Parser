Hello!
This Commit contains my code for a simple email parser 
(using a txt file downloaded from Google Mail)

Next Steps:

This parser may only work with this MIME type version and not other formats;
future steps would be to include parsing abilities in other MIME versions, and the ability to parse through attachments of most file types(images, documents, etc.) and also including other email fields that may need to be captured.
